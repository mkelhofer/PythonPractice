# Data types
# - strings - English stuff, for people to read.
# Numbers - something with digits and the stuff that goes with them (- or . or e)
# Floats, integers
# -- float has a . in it
# -- integer - has no .
# Booleans - True or false, 1 or 0, off or on *good flags for breaking loops
# lists - list of things. A single variable with many like parts
# dictionary - variable of a variable
# objects - we will deal with this later
